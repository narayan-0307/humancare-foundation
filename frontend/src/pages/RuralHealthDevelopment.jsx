        <p>
          Rural communities face the greatest healthcare challenges due to
          limited facilities, low awareness, and scarce emergency support. Our
          mission is to strengthen rural health systems by improving access to
          essential care, building emergency readiness through CPR & First Aid
          awareness, and bringing medical guidance directly to villages where it
          is needed the most.
